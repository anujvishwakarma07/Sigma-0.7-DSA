/**
 * ‚ùì Question 3: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
 * 
 * You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the i-th day.
 * Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction.
 * 
 * If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
 * 
 * ‚ú® Example 1:
 * Input: prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: 
 * Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6 - 1 = 5.
 * You must buy before you sell.
 * 
 * ‚ú® Example 2:
 * Input: prices = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: 
 * In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 * 
 * üîí Constraints:
 * - 1 <= prices.length <= 10^5
 * - 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4
